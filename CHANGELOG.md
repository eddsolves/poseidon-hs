- V 1.1.8.0: Renamed `--no-extract` to `--packagewise` , fixed its behaviour with implicit package selection, and clarified help text 
- V 1.1.7.0: Reorganized handling of duplicate individuals: Duplicates are now generally ignored, except in validate (can also be turned of with a new flag) and forge. The forgeString language features a new syntactic entity to select individuals specifically and thus resolve duplication conflicts
- V 1.1.6.0: Removed outdated --verbose from validate and ignore trailing slashes from --outPath
- V 1.1.5.0: Enabled reading and forging additional, unspecified variables in .janno files 
- V 1.1.4.2: Added parsing for Accession IDs (.janno file). Wrong entries are ignored, so this is non-breaking
- V 1.1.4.1: Added a small validation check for calibrated ages in the .janno file
- V 1.1.4.0: Changes to make poseidon-hs compatible with Poseidon v2.6.0 (backwards compatible with v2.5.0): contributor field optional, added orcid field for contributors, added more capture type options in janno files 
- V 1.1.3.1: Package reading will now fail if bib-entries are not found due to missing bibtex files
- V 1.1.3.0: Added new features to the server, updated logging, and new API for compatibility checks
- V 1.1.2.0: Replaced progress indicators with simple, sequential log messages for the download in fetch and the SNP-wise operations in forge and genoconvert
- V 1.1.1.3: Tiny change to make the documentation of --snpSet more clear
- V 1.1.1.2: Outsourced optparse-applicative parsers to an own library module. This is helpful for xerxes and other derived tools/libraries
- V 1.1.1.1: Finally removed the fstats dummy subcommand from trident. It lives in xerxes for a long time already
- V 1.1.1.0: More complete genotype data error handling to log them properly. Added an option --errLength to truncate overly long error messages
- V 1.1.0.2: Internal change of the Logging Monad, should not change anything on the user-end
- V 1.1.0.1: Added Ord instance to PoseidonEntity and SignedEntity
- V 1.1.0.0: Removed the short options (-r + -g + -s + -i) for the direct genotype data input. Also improved the trident input package and genotype data parsing by making pointless no-input situations impossible

- V 0.26.4: Replaced special characters in the validate subcommand report message
- V 0.26.3: Added an option --ignorePoseidonVersion to the update subcommand to allow updating packages that are outdated by Poseidon version. Poseidon versions are not ignored by default any more, thus reversing a change introduced in 0.26.1.
- V 0.26.2: Added a check to prevent an empty output package name in the init and forge subcommands
- V 0.26.1: Added an option to ignore a package's Poseidon version when reading it and activated that by default for the update subcommand
- V 0.26.0: Updated the library to Poseidon v2.5. This means a number of (breaking) changes in the structure of .janno files
- V 0.25.0: Moved fstats command into new tool `xerxes` provided by github package poseidon-analysis-hs in the same organisation
- V 0.24.4: Switched off geno-check upon server start

- V 0.22.0: Added a --minimal option for init and forge to create minimal packages without .janno and .bib (e.g. in automatic pipelines)
- V 0.21.3: Added a column name suggestion mechanism to the .janno file reading procedure
- V 0.21.2: Made trident survey more useful
- V 0.21.1: Simplified package creation in init and forge by enabling creation of deeper paths and by making the output package name argument optional
- V 0.21.0: Added a poseidonVersion pre-parsing check in the reading pipeline, which strictly excludes packages with missing or wrong version
- V 0.20.1: Updated poseidon-http-server with new APIs and updated previous APIs
- V 0.20.0: New forging algorithm, much faster, and new option --no-extract in forge. Also new minimal package template
- V 0.19.0: Replaced trident checksumupdate with the much more powerful trident update
- V 0.18.2: Added a golden test feature to make sure code changes do not accidentally modify the output of trident modules

- V 0.17.0: Added and changed fields in the POSEIDON.yml and .janno file data types as defined in Poseidon V 2.3.1
- V 0.16.0: Added a verbose switch to the package reading functions. It's only available with validate (--verbose) to show all sorts of additional output, at the moment only unspecified and missing janno columns
- V 0.15.2: Better handling of individuals linked to multiple groups/populations in list
- V 0.15.1: Completed the task in 0.14.2 with a newtype JannoSex to enable a custom Show action
- V 0.15.0: Introduced genotype data structure validation on the first 100 SNPs for the package reading process
- V 0.14.3: Small change in how progress indicators for reading/downloading packages and processing SNPs are printed. This should improve the output in cli-enviroments without the ability to overwrite already printed output
- V 0.14.2: Modified show instances of multiple janno column types and fixed output of list
- V 0.14.1: added more helpful error messages to forge
- V 0.14.0: Multiple minor changes: allowed multiple forgeStrings/fetchStrings and forgeFiles/fetchFiles, added readmeFile and changelogFile to the package data structures, relaxed duplicate check in forge to only stop if there is an overlap within the specific selection relevant for the new package

- V 0.7.1: Added a check for ID duplicates when reading package collections
- V 0.7.0: Made janno reading a lot more flexible
- V 0.6.0: Added the /individuals_all API to the webserver
- V 0.5.3: Replaced the .csl data-file setup for bibtex parsing with an in-code solution to solve a related issue with the binary executables
