- V 1.2.3.0: Gave `validate` the ability to check not just entire packages, but also individual package components (e.g. .janno or .bib files).
- V 1.2.2.0: Taught the server (`serve`) how to provide multiple named archives in parallel, with a modified `-d` interface on the command line and a new option `?archive=...` in the Web API. The client commands `fetch` and `list` can request information from different archives with a new option `--archive`.
- V 1.2.1.0: Introduced the interacting trident subcommands `chronicle` and `timetravel` for archive versioning. They are hidden from the command line documentation, because they are not relevant for the end user. As part of the changes a new runtime test mode was defined in the PoseidonIO environment, which can be enabled on the command line with `trident --testmode Testing`.
- V 1.2.0.0: Massive rework of the server client infrastructure, including the Web API. The server is now a (hidden) subcommand of trident, is capable of serving multiple versions of one package, and returns proper error messages in case of client version incompatibility. The server-client golden tests are running locally now without querying the production setup. These changes required significant refactoring in the code for the subcommands `fetch` and `list`, as well as in the internal modules `Package.hs`, `SecondaryTypes.hs`, with effects for the whole project.
- V 1.1.12.0: Implemented the changes for Poseidon v2.7.1, added stricter validation for the .ssf file, elevated the log level of broken lines from debug to error and switched to a new stylish-haskell version for linting.
- V 1.1.11.4: Fixed an issue in the .ssf implementation: Multiple columns must be treated as list columns.
- V 1.1.11.3: Re-implemented the `survey` subcommand with advanced type level magic to avoid hard to maintain boilerplate code. Again no user-facing changes in trident.
- V 1.1.11.2: Switch to stackage resolver LTS 20.17 for ghc-9.2.7. No user-facing changes in trident.
- V 1.1.11.1: Reworked the parts of the test infrastructure to make the golden tests structurally simpler and cleaner. No user-facing changes to trident.
- V 1.1.11.0: Implemented the changes and additions for the new schema release Poseidon v2.7.0: The sequencingSourceFile (.ssf) file, the new .janno columns (Country_ISO, Library_Names) and the small changes to existing columns (Library_Built).
- V 1.1.10.2: Added a missing default (`asFamily`) for the `--outPlinkPopName` option
- V 1.1.10.1: Internal refactoring. Introduced a newtype wrapper `JannoRows` for `[JannoRow]`, which is an instance of `Monoid`. This should encourage the use of a dedicated implementation of `mconcat` for `JannoRows`
- V 1.1.10.0: Added an option to `validate` (and therefore `readPoseidonPackage`) to test parsing the entire .bed/.geno file, not just the first 100 SNPs
- V 1.1.9.1: Small changes: made trident update write messages to the CHANGELOG file now with a prefix `-` (to make it proper markdown), turned off verbose debug-level warnings about missing standard columns in the .janno file and made the schema version mismatch error message clearer
- V 1.1.9.0: Added option to control the read/write of the population name from Plink FAM files more flexibly.
- V 1.1.8.6: Refactored the `-j` mechanism by which `list --individuals` includes additional variables in the output table. It is now possible to query arbitrary addititional columns
- V 1.1.8.5: Rolled back some of the ToJSON instances changed in 1.1.8.4 because they broke backwards compatibility of the server-client communication. Added some additional tests to prevent such oversights in the future. Slightly reorganized the golden tests
- V 1.1.8.4: Unified the implementation of ToJSON/FromJSON and ToField/FromField instances for .janno datatypes to perform input validation through smart constructors
- V 1.1.8.3: The fix in introduced in 1.1.8.1 introduced a bug: It broke valid unicode characters in .janno files and prevented reading them. The solution implemented here solves this issue
- V 1.1.8.2: Improved the behaviour of `list` when provided with undefined .janno columns in the `-j` argument
- V 1.1.8.1: Fixed an decoding-encoding bug in the janno code by generally trimming all whitespaces on reading and deleting No-Break Space characters
- V 1.1.8.0: Renamed `--no-extract` to `--packagewise`, fixed its behaviour with implicit package selection, and clarified help text
- V 1.1.7.2: Added a proper warning in `readPoseidonPackageCollection` if one or all baseDirs do not exist 
- V 1.1.7.1: Added a hint about `--logMode VerboseLog` to the important "Broken lines" error message in the .janno reading process
- V 1.1.7.0: Reorganized handling of duplicate individuals: Duplicates are now generally ignored, except in validate (can also be turned of with a new flag) and forge. The forgeString language features a new syntactic entity to select individuals specifically and thus resolve duplication conflicts
- V 1.1.6.0: Removed outdated --verbose from validate and ignore trailing slashes from --outPath
- V 1.1.5.0: Enabled reading and forging additional, unspecified variables in .janno files 
- V 1.1.4.2: Added parsing for Accession IDs (.janno file). Wrong entries are ignored, so this is non-breaking
- V 1.1.4.1: Added a small validation check for calibrated ages in the .janno file
- V 1.1.4.0: Changes to make poseidon-hs compatible with Poseidon v2.6.0 (backwards compatible with v2.5.0): contributor field optional, added orcid field for contributors, added more capture type options in janno files 
- V 1.1.3.1: Package reading will now fail if bib-entries are not found due to missing bibtex files
- V 1.1.3.0: Added new features to the server, updated logging, and new API for compatibility checks
- V 1.1.2.0: Replaced progress indicators with simple, sequential log messages for the download in fetch and the SNP-wise operations in forge and genoconvert
- V 1.1.1.3: Tiny change to make the documentation of --snpSet more clear
- V 1.1.1.2: Outsourced optparse-applicative parsers to an own library module. This is helpful for xerxes and other derived tools/libraries
- V 1.1.1.1: Finally removed the fstats dummy subcommand from trident. It lives in xerxes for a long time already
- V 1.1.1.0: More complete genotype data error handling to log them properly. Added an option --errLength to truncate overly long error messages
- V 1.1.0.2: Internal change of the Logging Monad, should not change anything on the user-end
- V 1.1.0.1: Added Ord instance to PoseidonEntity and SignedEntity
- V 1.1.0.0: Removed the short options (-r + -g + -s + -i) for the direct genotype data input. Also improved the trident input package and genotype data parsing by making pointless no-input situations impossible

- V 0.27.0: Improved EntitiesList parsing in Forge and Fetch 
- V 0.26.4: Replaced special characters in the validate subcommand report message
- V 0.26.3: Added an option --ignorePoseidonVersion to the update subcommand to allow updating packages that are outdated by Poseidon version. Poseidon versions are not ignored by default any more, thus reversing a change introduced in 0.26.1.
- V 0.26.2: Added a check to prevent an empty output package name in the init and forge subcommands
- V 0.26.1: Added an option to ignore a package's Poseidon version when reading it and activated that by default for the update subcommand
- V 0.26.0: Updated the library to Poseidon v2.5. This means a number of (breaking) changes in the structure of .janno files
- V 0.25.0: Moved fstats command into new tool `xerxes` provided by github package poseidon-analysis-hs in the same organisation

- V 0.15.1: Completed the task in 0.14.2 with a newtype JannoSex to enable a custom Show action
- V 0.15.0: Introduced genotype data structure validation on the first 100 SNPs for the package reading process
- V 0.14.3: Small change in how progress indicators for reading/downloading packages and processing SNPs are printed. This should improve the output in cli-enviroments without the ability to overwrite already printed output
- V 0.14.2: Modified show instances of multiple janno column types and fixed output of list
- V 0.14.1: added more helpful error messages to forge
- V 0.14.0: Multiple minor changes: allowed multiple forgeStrings/fetchStrings and forgeFiles/fetchFiles, added readmeFile and changelogFile to the package data structures, relaxed duplicate check in forge to only stop if there is an overlap within the specific selection relevant for the new package
